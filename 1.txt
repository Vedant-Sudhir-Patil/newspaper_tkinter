One Piece Is Getting an Anime Remake

Netflix is really stretching out its success with One Piece. The streamer announced that in addition to a second season of the hit live-action adaptation, it will be remaking the anime series, with its version titled The One Piece. It’s like the opposite of the whole “the Facebook” thing. It’ll be produced by WIT Studio, which made Spy X Family and Attack on Titan and will work closely with The One Piece production committee (Shueisha, Fuji Television Network, and Toei Animation Co.). It’s currently in production and they haven’t revealed a release date.
