Kouji Mori Discusses Continuing the Manga After Kentaro Miura's Passing

In a recent interview, Berserk's Kouji Mori discussed his decision to continue the manga after the passing of Kentaro Miura. Mori, who was Miura's best friend, explained that the decision was not an easy one, but that he ultimately felt it was the right thing to do.“During the three-to-four-hour meeting, I explained the development to Studio Gaga staff,” Mori said. “Afterward, I exchanged personal messages with the chief. I give advice on drafts, but the final drawings are the work of Studio Gaga. The drawing skills of our staff, including Chief Kurosaki-kun, are extraordinary. I believe that after they complete Berserk, they will become artists who will leave their mark on the manga world.”
